# AI-LLM Agent Specifications

This directory contains specification documents designed for AI-LLM agents interacting with the Insecure Banking application.

## Purpose

These specifications provide:

- Comprehensive project structure documentation
- Code conventions and best practices
- API references and patterns
- Testing and CI/CD guidelines
- Development workflow instructions
- Troubleshooting guides

## Documents

### agent-specification.md

The main specification document that serves as a complete reference for AI-LLM agents. This document includes:

1. **Project Overview** - Understanding the application's purpose and intentional vulnerabilities
2. **Technology Stack** - Detailed information about frameworks, libraries, and tools used
3. **Project Structure** - Complete directory layout and file organization
4. **Code Conventions** - Python and Django coding standards
5. **Development Workflow** - Setup, running, and maintaining the application
6. **Testing Strategy** - Test organization, execution, and coverage requirements
7. **Security Considerations** - Intentional vulnerabilities and security testing approach
8. **Build and Deployment** - CI/CD workflows and Docker containerization
9. **Common Tasks and Patterns** - Examples for common development tasks
10. **Agent Interaction Guidelines** - Best practices for different types of AI agents
11. **API Reference** - Complete API documentation for services and models
12. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Usage

AI-LLM agents should reference these specifications when:

- Analyzing code structure and patterns
- Generating or modifying code
- Running tests and validating changes
- Understanding security context (intentional vulnerabilities)
- Executing build and deployment tasks
- Creating documentation
- Performing refactoring operations

## Maintenance

These specifications should be updated when:

- Major architectural changes occur
- New services or models are added
- Testing strategies evolve
- CI/CD workflows are modified
- New development patterns are established
- Dependencies or technology stack changes

## Version History
